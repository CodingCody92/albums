        <p>Kendrick Lamar x Oklama? </p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <p><span id="italic">Damn</span>, released in 2016, feels as if he was released 10 years, just because we've
            been missing Kendrick Lamar that much. Its another addition to his already classic catalog, but we need
            another one. In an interview on I-D Magazine where he interviewed his protege and cousin, Baby Keem,
            Kendrick revealed that he was going to drop the album back in 2020, but because of COVID, he decided to hold
            off. We'll never get to hear that version of the album, as I am 200% sure that version of the album has been
            scrapped. August of 2021, he came out of hiding from his cave and posted on his social media accounts a
            note, entitled, <span id="note">nu thoughts</span>, where he revealed he has gone days without a phone, and
            thanking his fans for keeping him in our thoughts. Also, in sort of a shock, he revealed that his next
            upcoming album will be his last on record label TDE, and future releases will be under the pgLang imprint.
            Whatever label it releases under, we just need new music, man. </p>

        <p>Dr. Dre x Detox</p>
    </section>

    <article>
        <p><span id="italic">Look out for Detox</span>, a line that seems as if it has been in every rap album since
            2003, is as legendary as the album itself. The follow to the 1999 album, 2001, it was rumored to have a
            release date of summer 2003, has seen an unprecented amount of push backs and delays, for reasons unknown.
            The arrival of protege 50 Cent may have pushed the album back a year or 2, to assist in his developement,
            and right after him came The Game, a fellow west coast artist who he also had a hand in developing. Who
            knows if we'll ever hear this myth of an album?

        <p>Kanye West x Good Ass Job</p>

            It was already written for Kanye. Way way back in 2003, Mr. West spoke with MTV and laid out his 4 album
            plan, which originally concluded with Good Ass Job. Everything went as planned, as College Dropout, Late
            Registration, and Graduation all dropped, just as he predicted, but Good Ass Job did not follow up. Instead,
            we got 808s & Heartbreak, a deviation from what we normally expect from Ye, but a great ass album
            nonetheless. And then comes My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye at his absolute best. Fast forward a
            few years and in comes Chance the Rapper, who immediately starts working with Kanye, and they make great
            music together. In 2018, Chance tweets out #goodassjob, sparking rumors that they are working on the album
            together. And then The Big Day happens, and well....
